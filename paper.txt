1 Introduction
Developing Spatial Intelligence (SI) Sytems to perceive, reason, and interact within the physical
world is a long-standing challenge across cognitive science (Tolman, 1948; Shepard & Metzler,
1988; Newcombe & Huttenlocher, 2000), symbolic AI (Kuipers, 1978; 2000; Harnad, 1990), and
robotics (Durrant-Whyte & Bailey, 2006; Thrun, 2002). However, progress has historically been
limited by the lack of a unified model capable of integrating perception, reasoning, and action. The
emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their powerful vision-language
understanding and reasoning capabilities, has opened new opportunities for advancing SI.
Recentresearchonspatialintelligence(SI)inMLLMshaslargelyfollowedatask-centrictrajectory.
Early works focused on simple spatial tasks in single images (Ma et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a;
Fu et al., 2024), such as relative object positioning and size estimation. Later studies expanded
these tasks to 3D grounding, detection, and captioning from point clouds (Zhu et al., 2024; Hong
et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). With multi-view and video-capable VLMs, benchmarks quickly
diversified (Yang et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2025d;c; Gholami et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c; Jia
etal.,2025),coveringawidearrayoftasksfromspatiotemporalreasoningtoegocentricanddynamic
object understanding.
However, this prevailing task-centric approach, while foundational, has naturally led to a landscape
ofbenchmarksthatoftenfocusonspecific,sometimesoverlapping,spatialtasks. Thisfragmentation
makesitchallengingtogainaholisticviewofanMLLM’soverallspatialintelligenceortounderstand
the inherent dependencies between these skills. This motivates us to ask:
Can we move beyond fragmented, task-centric benchmarks to uncover a compact
set of atomic capabilities that capture spatial intelligence and its dependencies?
Inspired by Piaget’s theory in cognitive science Piaget (2013), we advocate acapability-centric
paradigm for spatial intelligence (SI). We further decompose SI into a multi-level capability tree
(Fig.1). Basedonthistaxonomy,weconstructthefirstcomprehensivebenchmarkforSIinMLLMs,
offering comprehensive ability coverage and a diverse set of evaluation metrics beyond simple
multiple-choicetestsusedinpriorworks. WealsodevelopaSpatialEngine,anextendableannotation
framework. Itintegratesmultipleperceptionmodelstogenerateannotationsforeachcapabilitylayer.
Atthehighestlevel(L4),weproposeaspatialactionmappingwhichconvertscontinuousactionsinto
discrete,high-levelmotionprimitives,providingMLLMswithanexecutableactionspaceforagentic
tasks. We leverage the proposed Spatial Engine to generate diverse annotation data from public
datasets covering video games, robot manipulation, and human-object interactions, with details
provided in Sec. 3.1. To cover the lower levels (L1–L3), we extract relevant portions from multiple
public datasets and benchmarks (Yang et al., 2025c;a; Jia et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025; Wang et al.,
2025c;2024a;Zhuetal.,2024;Yinetal.,2025;Xuetal.,2025;Liuetal.,2025),reorganizingthem
onto our capability tree. We further enrich questions and evaluation protocols to improve coverage
and cross-layer overlap. To address missing capabilities, we introduceSpatialPlus, generated by
SpatialEngine,encompassingOrientation(L1),MemoryRetrieval(L2),RelationalReasoning(L3),
and Agentic Competence (L4). All resulting data and annotations are systematically organized and
re-weighted within the SpatialTree benchmark to ensure balanced evaluation across layers.
Evaluation on SpatialTree-Bench reveals a clear hierarchical structure in spatial intelligence: low-
levelabilities(L1–L2)arelargelyindependent,whereashigher-levelabilities(L3–L4)exhibitstrong
interdependencies, reflecting their compositional nature. Furthermore, we observe that certain
foundational abilities—Geo.Size (L1), Geo.Dist (L1), and Relat.Corr (L2)—as well as higher-level
reasoning skills (L3) correlate strongly with agentic competence (L4). To systematically validate
these relationships, we design anatomic promptingprotocol: for L4 navigation tasks, we provide
MLLMs with additional prompts encoding relevant L1, L2, and L3 signals. By this, we find lower
level information could significantly improves performance on higher 3D agentic tasks, yielding
clear gains (e.g., w/ Corres: 12.1%, w/ Depth: 22.1%, w/ Size: 5.1%).
In summary, our work makes the following key contributions:
•Proposea capability-centric paradigm for spatial intelligence, offering a systematic and
interpretable framework beyond task-centric benchmarks.

Spatial Cognitive Modeling.Understanding spatial cognition has long been a central goal in
cognitive science and AI. A common insight from classical theories is that spatial abilities are
hierarchical, ranging from basic perception and sensorimotor interactions to higher-level reasoning
and planning. Piaget Piaget (2013) highlighted the developmental progression of such abilities,
Tolman Tolman (1948) introduced the idea of cognitive maps to represent environments for flexible
navigation,andKuipersKuipers(1978;2000)formalizedahierarchicalspatialrepresentationlinking
local perception to global knowledge. More recent symbolic and neural approaches Shepard &
Metzler(1988);Newcombe&Huttenlocher(2000)extendtheseinsightstocomputationalmodelsof
spatial representation, memory, and reasoning. These studies collectively motivate ourSpatialTree,
which organizes spatial intelligence into multi-level capabilities, bridging classical theory with
systematic computational evaluation.

complex, agentic decision-making. Collectively, these milestones progressively enable hierarchical

Benchmarks for Spatial Intelligence in MLLMs.Benchmarks for spatial abilities in MLLMs
have evolved alongside the models themselves. Early efforts, such as BLINK Fu et al. (2024),
SpatialEval Wang et al. (2024a), and 3DSR-Bench Ma et al. (2024), focused on evaluating spatial
understanding tasks in single images, including distance estimation, relational question answering,
and spatial captions. As MLLMs increasingly support multi-frame and video inputs, benchmarks
such as VSI-Bench Yang et al. (2025a) and MMSI-Bench Yang et al. (2025c) have emerged to

Built upon prior efforts, our SpatialTree benchmark systematically organizes spatial abilities into a
hierarchical framework, providing the first thorough evaluation across different capabilities.

are expected to output interactive actions executable across 3D environments and embodiments,
suchasgames,simulators,andthephysicalworld. UnlikeVision-LanguageActionModels(VLAs)
decording the low-level control signals in robotics (Intelligence et al., 2025), MLLMs take the
language as the only interface to link with environments like GUI Agents (Qin et al., 2025).

the most common forms of interaction within 3D environments. We address each with a distinct

controls (referring to recent video world models (Ball et al., 2025; Mao et al., 2025a)). To enable
precise and intuitive control, we decompose complex camera movements into a set of fundamental
motion primitives inspired by established cinematography techniques. This approach allows us to
translate high-level language instructions (e.g., "move to the left," "look up") into a structured, low-
levelactionspace. Thesixfundamentalprimitives,theircorrespondingcinematicterms,degreesof

analyzing MLLMs’ planning and manipulation competence.
Building on the proposed spatial action mapping, we curate annotated data from diverse sources,
including human-hand manipulation videos, navigation video games, robotic arm manipulation
datasets, and simulation environments. This unified dataset enables us to evaluate whether MLLMs
can accurately plan and execute actions in the defined metric action space. Further implementation
details are provided in Sec. 4 and in the experimental section.
3.2Mental Simulation
Reasoning and planning prior to action execution are essential components of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), aligning naturally with the Chain-of-Thought paradigm in language
model reasoning. In spatial cognitive science, this process is commonly referred to as mental
simulation. We further decompose mental simulation into two core components: causal reasoning
and sequential planning.
Causal Reasoningallows MLLMs to model spatial interactions, physical dynamics, and entity
relationships within a simulated mental space. It includes reasoning about object geometry (e.g.,
how shapes interlock in spatial puzzles), predicting motion under kinematic constraints (e.g., how
an object traverses a path), and analyzing semantic–spatial relations (e.g., object A is left of object
B). By mentally simulating cause–effect chains in spatial scenarios, MLLMs establish the logical
substrate for subsequent planning.
Sequential Planningconvertscausalinsightsintocoherent,goal-directedactionplansexpressedin
language. It entails designing high-level, step-by-step strategies (e.g., "first move toward the door,
then turn right, and finally interact with the handle") and generating abstract routes that respect
spatial logic (e.g., "go around the table to reach the sofa"). By chaining linguistic action primitives,
MLLMs produce strategic plans that ensure the conceptual sequence aligns with the overarching
goal before any low-level execution.

the environment by relying on two essential facets. The first is spatial understanding: the ability to
interprettheimmediatescene. Thisincludesrecognizingobjectsandtheiraffordances,mappingthe
spatial relations between them, and understanding the scene from various perspectives (perspective
taking). In essence, it’s about making sense of what is currently perceived. The second facet is
memory. It allows the agent to retain this understanding over time, retrieving past observations to
buildacognitivemapthatextendsfarbeyondthecurrentfieldofview. Thiscreatesapersistentand
comprehensive mental model of the world. Ultimately, these two facets—understanding the present
andrememberingthepast—organizeandintegratethefoundationalperceptualdatafromL1,paving
the way for L3’s predictive simulations.
3.4Perception
Perception forms the foundation for high-level spatial reasoning. We categorize L1 Perception into
five core aspects:Orientation: Captures spatial alignment, crucial for understanding the agent’s
pose and maintaining balance. Key sub-tasks areGravity(estimating pitch and roll to determine
“up”/“down”) andObject Orientation(recognizing object poses), supporting scene reconstruction
and manipulation.Geometry: Involves spatial form, size, and metric relationships. Sub-tasks
includeSize,Shape, andDistance, enabling reasoning about object properties and facilitating nav-
igation and grasping.Motion: Encodes spatial dynamics over time. Sub-tasks areEgocentric
Motion(self-motion estimation) andAllocentric Motion(tracking object or scene changes), critical
for predicting future states and planning actions.Relation: Concerns spatial relationships between
entities. Sub-tasks includeCorrespondence(matching entities across views) andRelative Direc-
tion(e.g., left of, in front of), supporting object tracking, path planning, and interaction reasoning.
Localization: Anchors perception within 3D space. Sub-tasks include3D Detection(identify-
ing object extents) and3D Grounding(associating observations with coordinates), enabling scene
reconstruction, navigation, and embodied reasoning.
4 Spatial Engine: Our Data Annotator Pipeline
We propose an extensible data engine designed to generate annotations for every layer of the Spa-
tialTree. Our approach begins with a diverse set of low-level 3D perception models, each tailored
to a specific task, including metric depth estimation (Wang et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2024), ori-
entation estimation (Wang et al., 2024b), gravity estimation (Veicht et al., 2024), correspondence
matching (Leroy et al., 2024; Xiangli et al., 2025), 3D localization (Mao et al., 2025b), 3D point
tracking(Xiaoetal.,2024;2025),andcameraposeestimation(Wangetal.,2025a;e). Nevertheless,
allthesecomprehensive3Dperceptionmodelscanbeseamlesslyencompassedwithinourtaxonomy
of five perception abilities.
Data Annotation Framework.As shown in Figure 3, our pipeline encapsulates three hierarchical
entities: models, pipelines, and workflows. The lowest level comprises the perception models de-
scribed above, along with advanced MLLMs for semantic captioning. Building upon these models,
we construct several reusable pipelines that serve as atomic components for higher-level workflows.
Specifically, we implement 12 pipelines, including metric 3D reconstruction, 3D orientation align-
ment, 3D point tracking, and affordance pointing. Each pipeline processes raw sensory data, such
as RGB images or 3D point clouds, and produces intermediate outputs that are further integrated
by the workflows. Based on these pipelines, we assemble 24 workflows, each targeting a specific
perception ability or a combination of abilities, to generate comprehensive annotations for our Spa-
tialTree. Thesereusablepipelinesnotonlystreamlinetheannotationprocessbutalsofacilitatefuture
extension to new tasks or models. Overall, this hierarchical design ensures modularity, scalability,
and a clear separation of responsibilities across models, pipelines, and workflows.

5 Experiments
This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the hierarchical spatial reasoning capabilities
of advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using ourSpatialTreeframework. Our
objectivesaretwofold: 1)toestablishafine-grainedcapabilitybenchmarkforcurrentMLLMsacross
all levels of theSpatialTree, and 2) to analyze the dependencies between foundational spatial skills
and their influence on higher-level abilities, such as spatial reasoning.
5.1 Models and Metrics
Benchmarked Models.We select a diverse set of state-of-the-art MLLMs for our evaluation,
ensuring broad coverage of model families, architectures, and functional paradigms. Our selection
spans three key dimensions: (1)reasoning-focused closed-source modelsrenowned for advanced
general reasoning capabilities, including GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024), and GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025);
Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Comanici et al., 2025); Anthropic’s Claude 3.7
Sonnet (Anthropic, 2025); and GLM-4.5V Hong et al. (2025), SeedVL1.5 Guo et al. (2025b); (2)
non-reasoningmodelssuchasGemini-2.5-Pro-NonthinkComanicietal.(2025),Gemini-2.5-Flash-
Nonthinking, and SeedVL1.5-Nonthink (Guo et al., 2025b), which represent specialized paradigms
outside traditional reasoning-centric designs; and (3)open-source models(e.g., Qwen25VL (Bai
et al., 2025) series and Kimi-VL (Team et al., 2025)) that reflect the cutting edge of community-
driven research. This deliberate diversity allows us to compare performance across reasoning vs.

Evaluation Metrics.Our evaluation employs a multi-faceted set of metrics tailored to the specific
abilities at each level of the SpatialTree. For perception and understanding tasks (L1-L2), we
primarily use accuracy-based metrics, such as classification accuracy for object recognition, Mean
Squared Error (MSE) for distance estimation, and angular difference for orientation tasks. For
higher-level reasoning and planning tasks (L3-L4), we measure task success rates. In the case of
agentic tasks (L4), we further analyze the quality of generated actions using metrics like positional
error (L2 distance) and orientation error (angular difference) against ground-truth trajectories.

To explore the structure of spatial
intelligence in MLLMs, we analyze
thedependenciesamongfine-grained
sub-abilities using the Pearson cor-
relation coefficient. A high positive
correlation indicates that models per-
forming well on one ability tend to
perform well on the other. Fig. 4

sitional nature in spatial abilities:

performanceinothers. Atthelowestlevel(L1),atomicabilitiesexhibitweakcorrelations,indicating
thattheyarelargelyindependent. Foundationalskillssuchasshapeperception,distanceestimation,
and relative direction capture distinct aspects of spatial perception. This orthogonality provides a
diverse and comprehensive perceptual foundation for the model.
Finally, we identify a set of low-level critical abilities that act as prerequisites for a wide range
of higher-level competencies. For example, strong performance in geometric perception tasks,
particularly distance estimation (L1-Geo.Dist) and size estimation (L1-Geo.Size), shows a strong
positive correlation with many advanced abilities, including open exploration (L4-Open.Expl.),
and causal reasoning (L3-Seq.Plan.Ope, L3-Caus.Reas.Rel). This indicates that a model’s ability
to perceive fundamental geometric properties is a cornerstone upon which more abstract spatial
reasoning is constructed. These findings strongly support our hypothesis that a core set of atomic
abilities forms the basis for the emergence of broader spatial intelligence in MLLM.

6 Conclusion and Discussion
Weproposethefirstcapability-centricSpatialIntelligenceframework,SpatialTree,organizingspatial
capabilities into four hierarchical layers. Our experiments reveal the compositional structure of
these abilities, showing how foundational skills support higher-level performance. Leveraging the
scalability of SpatialTree and SpatialEngine, we can systematically generate tasks and annotations
guided by the capability hierarchy, providing a framework to enhance pre-training and SFT, and to
accelerate the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs.

existing datasets and mapping them to our capability tree, whereSpatialPlus, a complementary
dataset are introduced to ensure the capability coverage.
A Visualization of Data Sources
How different datasets contribute to our SpatialTree evaluation is shown in Fig. A.
B Evaluation Metrics Details
Multi-Option QAs.Formulti-optionquestionanswering,eachmodelisevaluatedonitsabilityto
select the correct option from a predefined set. We measure accuracy by comparing the predicted
choice against the ground-truth answer. This paradigm captures a model’s understanding of spatial
relations, object properties, and causal dynamics within a scene, corresponding to the low- and
mid-level capabilities in the SpatialTree (L1–L3).
Numeric QAs.Numeric QAs require models to predict continuous quantities such as distances,
angles, or 3D coordinates. We evaluate performance using relative error metrics, for example:
Relative Error=|ˆ𝑦−𝑦|
|𝑦|,
whereˆ𝑦is the predicted value and𝑦is the ground truth. This metric ensures that predictions are
scaled appropriately across different magnitudes and emphasizes precision in spatial reasoning.
GPT Judge.For tasks that are open-ended or involve complex reasoning (e.g., trajectory descrip-
tion, action sequence explanation), we leverage a GPT-based judge to assess correctness. The judge
evaluates whether the generated response satisfies the task requirements, optionally scoring par-
tial correctness. This approach allows flexible evaluation beyond rigid numeric or multiple-choice
formats, especially for mid- and high-level capabilities in L3–L4.

Agentic Evaluation.To assess agentic competence, models are deployed in interactive simulated
environments,suchasthoseprovidedbyEmbodiedBench(Yangetal.,2025b). Weevaluatenaviga-
tion and manipulation tasks along multiple dimensions: success rate in completing the target goal,
relative translation accuracy, and directional alignment. For each action step, a combined metric is
computedusingrelativedistanceandcosinesimilarityofmovementvectors,producinganormalized
score in[0,1]. Aggregating scores over all steps yields a comprehensive measure of an agent’s
ability to plan and execute actions in long-horizon, embodied tasks.
C SpatialPlus: Complementary Data Annotations for SpatialTree
C.1 Orientations (L1)
The Orientation capability, a fundamental yet under-explored area, involves estimating both gravity
direction and 3D object orientation. To generate annotations, we leveraged Geocalib Veicht et al.
(2024) for gravity vector estimation and OrientAnything Wang et al. (2024b) for object poses. We
applied these tools to datasets suited for each task: for gravity, we annotated 500 images sampled
from the diverse, drone-captured TartanAir Wang et al. (2020) dataset; for object orientation, we
utilizedtheobject-centricCo3dv2Reizensteinetal.(2021)dataset(SeeninFig.B).Forgravity,the
goalistoestimatethecamera’sorientationrelativetothegravityvector,typicallyrepresentedbythe
pitchandrollangles. Formally, let the gravity vector in the world frame be:
g𝑤="0
0
−1#
,(3)
and letR 𝑐𝑤∈𝑆𝑂(3)denote the rotation from the world frame to the camera frame. The gravity
direction in the camera frame is then:
g𝑐=R 𝑐𝑤g𝑤.(4)
Fromg 𝑐=[𝑔 𝑥,𝑔𝑦,𝑔𝑧]⊤, the pitch and roll angles can be computed as:
pitch=arctan 2(−𝑔 𝑥,√︃
𝑔2𝑦+𝑔2𝑧),(5)
roll=arctan 2(𝑔 𝑦,𝑔𝑧).(6)
Here,pitchmeasurestheforward–backwardtiltofthecamera,whilerollmeasuresthesidewaystilt.
To evaluate an MLLM’s proficiency in this task, we require the model to analyze the input image
and return these same three parameters in a structured JSON format. An example of our prompt
template is shown in Listing 1.

Goal-driven Navigation.We leverage our SpatialEngine to get the action annotations as shown
in Fig. C. We first extract the metric pose trajectories from the games videos, and convert them
into discrete actions with our spatial action mapping, and then we randomly sample several image
pairs from the video with the correspondence checking. For evaluation, the goal is a image, and the
MLLMs are supposed to control the character to move to the target positions. We use the prompt
template as below:

Therelative distance scoreis defined as:
𝑠𝑑=max
0,1−∥Δppred−Δpgt∥
∥Δpgt∥
,
and thedirectional scoreis computed by the cosine similarity:
𝑠𝜃=Δppred·Δpgt
∥Δppred∥∥Δpgt∥.
The final step-wise accuracy is then:𝑠 step=𝑠𝑑·max(0,𝑠 𝜃)
which ensures a value in[0,1], where 1 indicates perfect alignment in both distance and direction.
Aggregating𝑠 stepacross all steps provides a comprehensive measure of the model’s precision in
executing end-effector motions.
Goal-driven ManipulationFor theGoal-Driven Manipulationcapability, we utilize action an-
notations from theDroidKhazatsky et al. (2024) andEgoDexHoque et al. (2025) datasets. This
task requires the MLLM to generate a sequence of precise actions to move a robot end-effector or
a human hand from a starting state to a target state, both specified by images. The action space for
Droidencompasses7-DoFcontrol: 6-DoFfortheend-effector’spose(translationandrotation)and
abinarystateforthegripper(open/close). AsimilaractionspaceisadaptedforEgoDex,controlling
wrist pose and finger grip. The MLLM is prompted to generate a sequence of continuous action
vectors, as shown in the template below:
ToevaluatetheMLLM’sperformance,weassesstheaccuracyofthepredictedactionsequenceagainst
the ground truth. For the translational component of the motion, we reuse the step-wise accuracy
metric𝑠 stepfrom the navigation task, which combines relative distance and directional scores. For
the rotational component, we compute a normalized score based on the angular difference between
the predicted orientation and the ground truth. Let𝑅 predand𝑅gtbe the predicted and ground-truth
rotationmatricesforastep. Therotationalerrorangle𝜃 erriscalculatedfromtheerrorrotationmatrix
𝑅err=𝑅pred𝑅𝑇

.
Therotation score𝑠 rotis then defined as:
𝑠rot=max
0,1−𝜃err
𝜋
,
which normalizes the error to a[0,1]range, where 1 indicates a perfect rotational match. Finally,
thegripper score𝑠 gripperis a binary accuracy (1 if the predicted state matches the ground truth, 0
otherwise). Thefinalscoreforeachstepisaweightedcombinationofthesethreemetrics,providing
a holistic evaluation of the model’s ability to perform precise, multi-faceted manipulation tasks.
D Embodied Agent Evaluation within Simulation
EmbodiedBench(Yangetal.,2025b)providesaclosed-loopevaluationframeworkinwhichMLLMs
are deployed within interactive simulators. It includes four primary environments—EB-ALFRED,
EB-Habitat,EB-Navigation,andEB-Manipulation—supportinglong-horizontasksthatrequireboth
high-levelplanningandlow-levelcontrol. Followingthebenchmark’sevaluationprotocol,weassess
our models’ navigation and manipulation capabilities in these simulated settings.
E Benchmark Metric Aggregation
To derive a single, comprehensive score for a model’s spatial intelligence, we employ a hierarchical
aggregation methodology. This approach is designed to reflect the complex, multi-layered nature
of spatial cognition, rather than treating all abilities as equally important. The design is principally
guided by established theories in cognitive psychology, which posit that spatial intelligence is
constructedhierarchically,withfundamentalperceptualskillsformingthebedrockformoreabstract
reasoning and planning.

OuraggregationframeworkisbuiltupontheSpatialTreestructure. Theassignmentofweightswithin
this tree is determined by a synthesis of theoretical principles and empirical, data-driven insights:
Cognitive Hierarchy.In line with cognitive science literature, our weighting scheme prioritizes
foundational capabilities, as shown in Fig. D. The L1 layer, which represents low-level spatial
perception, is assigned the largest weight, as these skills are prerequisites for almost all higher-level
spatial tasks found in L2 (Mental Mapping) and L3 (Mental Simulation).
Empirical Dependency from Correlation Analysis.The theoretical hierarchy is further refined
andvalidatedbyourempiricalfindingsfromthePearsoncorrelationheatmap(Fig.??). Theheatmap
allows us to identifyatomic abilitiesthat exhibit strong, widespread correlations with a multitude
of other skills. These influential abilities are considered more fundamental to the overall spatial
intelligencenetworkandareconsequentlyassignedhigherweightswithintheirrespectivesub-trees.
This ensures our metric is not just theoretically sound, but also reflects the actual dependencies
observed in model performance.
The final score is calculated via a bottom-up, weighted summation. The performance score for any
parent node in the tree is the weighted sum of the scores of its immediate children. This process is

F LLM Usage Declarations
We declare that Large Language Models (LLMs) were used in a limited capacity during the prepa-
ration of this manuscript. Specifically, LLMs were employed for grammar checking, word choice
refinement,andtypocorrection. Allcoretechnicalcontributions,experimentaldesign,analysis,and
conclusions are entirely our own. The use of LLMs did not influence the scientific methodology,
result interpretation, or theoretical contributions of this research.

"content": "Task Details:\n
Compare the start image <Image 1> and target image <Image 2> to infer the
translation and rotation required for the robot arm's end-effector.\n ↩→
Decompose the motion into up to 6 steps, each combining any number of
elementary actions.\n\n↩→
Action Space:\n
We define a 7D action vector per step:\n
[dx, dy, dz, d_roll, d_pitch, d_yaw, gripper_state]\n
- Translation (dx, dy, dz): Displacement in meters along +X, +Y, +Z.\n
- Rotation (d_roll, d_pitch, d_yaw): Rotation in radians about +Z, +X, +Y
respectively.\n↩→
- gripper_state: 0=open, 1=closed.\n\n
Each dx, dy, dz, d_roll, d_pitch, d_yaw is computed from selected actions and
their step_nums:\n↩→
Δq = step_num×unit_step_size (translation in meters or rotation in
radians)\n\n↩→
Available Actions:\n
W/S: Dolly In/Out (+/-Z)\n
A/D: Truck Left/Right (-/+X)\n
space/shift: Pedestal Up/Down (-/+Y)\n
←/→: Pan Left/Right (±yaw)\n
↑/↓: Tilt Up/Down (±pitch)\n
R⃝/L⃝: Roll CW/CCW (±roll)\n
STOP: No movement\n\n
Output Format:\n
Return a single JSON object where each step is a key (\"step_1\", \"step_2\",
...).\n↩→
Each step contains:\n
- actions: a list of action symbols\n
- step_nums: a list of integers specifying intensity (1–10)\n
- gripper: 0 or 1 for gripper state\n\n
Example:\n
{
\"step_1\": {
\"actions\": [\"W\", \"A\"],
\"step_nums\": [5, 2],
\"gripper\": 0
},
\"step_2\": {
\"actions\": [\" R⃝\"],
\"step_nums\": [3],
\"gripper\": 1
}
}"
